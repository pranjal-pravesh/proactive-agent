Turn 1:
  User: What is the meaning of life?
  Assistant: The meaning of life is a question that has been discussed by philosophers, scientists, and people around the world for centuries. It is a personal and subjective question, as each person has their own perspective on what gives life purpose and significance. Some may find meaning in love, creativity, or contributing to others, while others may seek meaning in personal growth, exploration, or spiritual practices. Ultimately, the meaning of life is a deeply individual and complex question that varies from person to person.
