 [2025-05-29 15:34:56] Hello, my name is Robert.
[2025-05-29 15:35:48] I have three meetings scheduled tomorrow. One is at 7pm, second is at 2pm.
[2025-05-29 15:35:51] It is at 1 p.m.
[2025-05-29 22:30:41] and the plant is located.
[2025-05-29 22:31:32] We'll cover it, isn't it?
[2025-05-29 22:31:48] I'll be right back.
[2025-05-29 22:31:57] I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say
[2025-05-29 22:32:04] It's important you fund it.
[2025-05-29 22:32:25] I don't know if I'm just
[2025-05-29 22:38:29] Okay, what was I talking about? I forgot.
[2025-05-29 22:39:16] I know the hell is Robert.
[2025-05-29 22:48:10] You know my name.
[2025-05-29 22:51:33] I don't know my name
[2025-05-29 22:58:48] I wanted if you know my name
[2025-05-29 23:01:35] Excuse me, I'm going to mute them all out.
[2025-05-29 23:04:41] So, I want to move back to you.
[2025-05-29 23:04:53] I almost do you normal.
[2025-05-30 16:06:40] I don't know whether it's in the hotel or in the weather or anything like that.
[2025-05-30 16:07:51] the wash detection is taking 0.01 second, the transfection is taking 1.5 second and the  lambda response is taking 4.60 second. So the total processing time will be over.
[2025-05-30 16:08:20] If the worst detection takes 0 to 2 seconds, transcription takes 2.12 seconds and LLM response  takes 0 seconds, it will be the total processing.
[2025-05-30 16:08:43] what was my last message that I sent to you.
[2025-05-30 17:47:54] So you are able to understand what I spoke earlier, because you know my chat history.
[2025-05-30 17:51:30] But you can still say anything like anything you want. I want to just know what are your viewpoints?
[2025-05-30 17:51:54] So what was my question again, I forgot.
[2025-05-30 17:52:37] I meant one
[2025-05-30 17:52:53] I meant one more M-O-L-E
[2025-05-30 19:42:19] Okay, now the issue is solved
[2025-05-30 19:43:45] what is 7 factorial divided by 2 factorial is factorial.
[2025-05-30 19:45:43] Now you are going to do a lot of calculations.
[2025-05-30 20:03:08] If a car is moving at the speed of 100 km per hour, how can I calculate speed in meter per second?
[2025-05-30 20:16:50] It won't be necessary to say random things like that, that it's a reply to your things.  This reply will only be given when you feel that it's a reply to what you're saying.
[2025-05-30 20:17:00] Thank you very much.
[2025-05-30 20:17:21] I don't need to say anything like that.
[2025-05-30 20:17:55] How do you know 24-7 center?  That's what I'm talking about, I'm transcribing it.
[2025-05-30 20:18:29] Thank you for all the good news that I have.
[2025-05-30 20:18:55] I will have to continue this.
[2025-05-30 20:19:07] No more than a slush dog, I don't know.
[2025-05-30 20:51:41] Why not? You are an assistant that is going to help me. So why can't you provide information?
[2025-05-30 20:53:04] That is the meaning of life.
[2025-05-30 20:53:36] if you tell me according to your own knowledge.
[2025-05-30 20:53:46] being such a sh-
[2025-05-30 21:03:08] If the radius of a circle is 9 cm, it's area.
[2025-05-30 21:03:23] If the radius of a circle is 9 cm then it's area.
[2025-05-30 21:05:38] it is a sphere then what will be the total surface.
[2025-05-30 21:06:07] I'll see you in the next video.  Bye.
[2025-05-30 21:06:59] of this sphere will be 7 cm, what will be its total surface area and what will be the
[2025-05-30 21:12:14] who I meant the country I was talking about.
[2025-05-30 23:54:34] Thank you very much for being on the show.
[2025-05-30 23:58:16] I had once told you about my meeting timings, you can search from in January.
[2025-05-31 00:02:11] to solve it again, I did not get the correct answer.
[2025-05-31 00:02:30] I did not get
[2025-05-31 00:03:09] Recently I made a creating classifier that can classify things as context table or non-context table and can also
[2025-05-31 00:04:38] And that's it.  Thank you very much.  Have a nice day.  Bye.
[2025-05-31 00:06:32] You know what I think, don't think, you don't.
