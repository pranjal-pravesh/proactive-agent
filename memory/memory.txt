 [2025-05-29 15:34:56] Hello, my name is Robert.
[2025-05-29 15:35:48] I have three meetings scheduled tomorrow. One is at 7pm, second is at 2pm.
[2025-05-29 15:35:51] It is at 1 p.m.
[2025-05-29 22:30:41] and the plant is located.
[2025-05-29 22:31:32] We'll cover it, isn't it?
[2025-05-29 22:31:48] I'll be right back.
[2025-05-29 22:31:57] I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say
[2025-05-29 22:32:04] It's important you fund it.
[2025-05-29 22:32:25] I don't know if I'm just
[2025-05-29 22:38:29] Okay, what was I talking about? I forgot.
[2025-05-29 22:39:16] I know the hell is Robert.
[2025-05-29 22:48:10] You know my name.
[2025-05-29 22:51:33] I don't know my name
[2025-05-29 22:58:48] I wanted if you know my name
[2025-05-29 23:01:35] Excuse me, I'm going to mute them all out.
[2025-05-29 23:04:41] So, I want to move back to you.
[2025-05-29 23:04:53] I almost do you normal.
[2025-05-30 16:06:40] I don't know whether it's in the hotel or in the weather or anything like that.
[2025-05-30 16:07:51] the wash detection is taking 0.01 second, the transfection is taking 1.5 second and the  lambda response is taking 4.60 second. So the total processing time will be over.
[2025-05-30 16:08:20] If the worst detection takes 0 to 2 seconds, transcription takes 2.12 seconds and LLM response  takes 0 seconds, it will be the total processing.
[2025-05-30 16:08:43] what was my last message that I sent to you.
[2025-05-30 17:47:54] So you are able to understand what I spoke earlier, because you know my chat history.
[2025-05-30 17:51:30] But you can still say anything like anything you want. I want to just know what are your viewpoints?
[2025-05-30 17:51:54] So what was my question again, I forgot.
[2025-05-30 17:52:37] I meant one
[2025-05-30 17:52:53] I meant one more M-O-L-E
